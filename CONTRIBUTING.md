## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Rust** 1.70+ (via rustup)
- **Python** 3.10+
- **Qontinui library** installed (`poetry install` in qontinui repo)
- **MultiState library** installed (`poetry install` in multistate repo)

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qontinui-runner.git
cd qontinui-runner

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install Python bridge dependencies
cd python-bridge
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev
```

```

## Code Style

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React hooks patterns
- Use functional components
- Format with Prettier
- Lint with ESLint

### Backend (Rust)

- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Run `cargo clippy` for linting
- Handle errors properly (Result types)

### Python Bridge

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Format with black
- Minimal code - delegate to qontinui library

## Testing

### Frontend Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### End-to-End Testing

1. Build the app: `npm run tauri build`
2. Install and test the built application
3. Test on target platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux)

### Python Bridge Tests

```bash
cd python-bridge
pytest
```

## Building for Release

```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run tauri build

# Output will be in src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows

- Requires MSVC toolchain
- May need to exclude .cargo directory from antivirus

### macOS

- Requires Xcode command line tools
- App needs to be signed for distribution

### Linux

- Requires additional system dependencies (see Tauri docs)
- Different package formats available (AppImage, deb, rpm)

## Areas for Contribution

### Good First Issues

- UI improvements
- Bug fixes
- Documentation
- Example automations

### Feature Development

- New UI components
- Configuration editor improvements
- Execution monitoring
- Error reporting improvements

### Platform Support

- Linux support
- macOS optimization
- Mobile platforms (future)

## Architecture

Qontinui Runner is a **Tauri application** with three layers:

1. **Frontend** (React/TypeScript): User interface
2. **Backend** (Rust/Tauri): Native OS integration
3. **Python Bridge**: Communication with qontinui library

The Python bridge is minimal - it delegates all automation logic to the qontinui library.

## Dependencies

- **[Qontinui](https://github.com/yourusername/qontinui)** - Core automation library
- **[MultiState](https://github.com/jspinak/multistate)** - State management
- **Tauri** - Desktop app framework
- **React** - UI framework

## Questions?

- Open an issue for questions
- Check Tauri documentation for framework questions
- Check qontinui docs for automation questions
